    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently a final year undergraduate at De Montfort University studying towards obtaining a BSC Computer Science (Hons) degree. My excellent communication and organisational skills, coupled with my desire to achieve highly, allowed me to secure a number of work experience placements. As a result, I was able to balance my professional development, whilst ensuring I excelled academically â€“ achieving a First class during my first two years of university.</p>

    <p>My ability to self-evaluate and desire to continue my professional development, makes me well suited for a graduate position, given the transferable nature of my skill set. I am eager to exploit further opportunities and aim to pursue a career within the technology sector</p>
